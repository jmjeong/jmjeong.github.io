#### Contributors  

I'd like to thank the following people who had helped me to develop the program: 

* The members of Chollian PDA SIG. Especially, WOOKJIN, FILIIDEI and PUNGMUL. 
* JungYoon Park, Alan Hecht - who sent me icons of HappyDays. 
* Wolfgang Fahl - Author of Birthdate for Pilot. I was inspired by the idea to create a birthdate tracking program from it. 
* Mitch Blevins - Creator of Diddlebug. And he has maintained the link to the GPL programs for the Palm which was helpful to me. 
* Chris Faherty - Creator of [Hot date](http://www.america.com/~chrisf/web/pilot/pilot.html) program which I referred to. 
* Bevan Ting - who provided helpful comments and corrected many grammatical errors in HappyDays page. But if there remain any errors, it's due to my carelessness. 
* And the many people who gave bug reports or suggestions for improvement.

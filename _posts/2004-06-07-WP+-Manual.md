#### Day View

![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7139/13244215195_2ab5b4a340_o.gif)

WP+ has the ability to hide certain appt/todo from view. It only hides items if you tell WP+ to hide them. The most common example is a category that you normally do not want displayed (such as a personal category when you are at work and vice-versa). You might also decide to hide completed ToDoâ€™s. If WP+ finds that there would be one or more todos on the currently displayed date that are not displaying because of your preference settings, it puts a 'A' at next the Day panel  to alert you to the fact that there are some items on that day that are not being displayed.
If you tap the 'A', it is changed into 'H' and all items normally hidden will be displayed.
The 'A' does not necessarily mean that there are appts/todos that was hidden. It means that there is possibility of existing hidden appts/todos.

#### Week View(1 week and 2 week)

For better readability, view and edit form is separated in WP+. If you write the predefined tag in edit form, it is parsed and drawed in view form. 

The following is the grammar used in edit form. You can refer this grammar in Syntax Help menu.

- 'bold' - **bold** text
- "Large" - <font size="+1">Large</font> text
- \[HyperLink\] - HyperLink
- ; - New line
- \- - Itemize,  The more '-' is , the more sub level is. 
- \: - Indentation, The more ':', the more indentation is.

'\;', '-', '\:' is valid only in the first chars after new line.
